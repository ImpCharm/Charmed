I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 410, in script
    "[anonTalk("#fff")]" "If you're playing this game via the .exe file, and you have discord open on your computer, your status will show that you're playing this game. You can disable this by playing the browser version, or by going to Discord -> user settings -> registered games -> charmed -> X"
Exception: String '[anonTalk(' ends with an open format operation.
